Your response goes here!

I have not really learned new skills so far, but i have had the chance to work
on previously learned skills.

Until now, i feel comfortable with what i've been learning, so i might say that most
of challenges have been easy.

At first i didn't get to make the Udacity extension to work. But i solved it.

Until now, yes i have used some of the solving strategies. Such as searching on the web
to solve a problem.
